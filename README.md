This is a semi-old, but in development version of my personal website meant to be run on a server (instead of static). The main feature of this being worked on is the "box packer" which is a tool to invintory boxes and their contents and print lables with qr codes, content list, warnings, and destination. Most recently used this app when I moved to orginize what I had.
